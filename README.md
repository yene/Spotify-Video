## Setup
* Install dependencies `carthage update --platform Mac`

## Credits
* [Iconic](https://useiconic.com/) for the awesome icon.

## Notes
* It uses [Sparkle for Github](https://github.com/yene/Sparkle-for-Github) to update.
* URL format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

## Todo
* add progress indicator and go blank between loading videos -> maybe fade to black
* test with spotify free and the ads
* remove the small border around the imageview
* set the view background to black

## Maybe Later
* let the user skip to the next youtube video


## Credits and Material
* Example implementation taken from https://gist.github.com/kwylez/5337918
* http://blog.corywiles.com/now-playing-with-spotify-and-itunes

## Getting Spotify and iTunes bridge headers
* `sdef /Applications/iTunes.app | sdp -fh --basename iTunes`

## How to release an update
A quick guide for me:

* Increase Version
* Commit all files
* Push master to Github
* In Xcode archive Version and Export a Developer ID-signed Application
* Zip the exported application
* On github create a new release with the same version (and add a v in front like v2.0)

# Notes on interaction with Shazam
Shazam does not publish the current song to notification. Report this to the devs. -> send bug report

# Notes on interaction with iTunes
iTunes does not publish the current "Playback Position" when the song gets paused/played. -> send bug report

# Notes on interaction with Spotify
* Only sends notification when sound changes, play, pause.
* Does not send notification when a looping track ends. -> send bug report
